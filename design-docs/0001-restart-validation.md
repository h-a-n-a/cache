# Restart Validation

## Why this is needed

A persistent cache survives a process restart. A file watcher attached to the
process does not observe changes while that process is stopped. Before reusing
cached work, Rolldown needs to check whether its inputs still match.

For example, a plugin transforms `a.ts` using `theme.json`:

```javascript
transform(code, id) {
  this.addWatchFile("theme.json");
  return convert(code, readTheme());
}
```

If `theme.json` changes while Rolldown is stopped, the saved result may be stale
even though `a.ts` has not changed.

Given tracked files and their saved validation information, Restart Validation
detects differences from the cached baseline.

## Proposed approach

Use content hashes to detect file changes across restarts.

For each tracked file, save whether it exists and its content hash if it does.

On restart, validate tracked files before reusing cached results:

- If the file was created or deleted, report it as changed.
- If it exists, read its contents and compare the hash with the saved hash.
- If the hashes differ, report it as changed. Otherwise, report it as unchanged.

Check each file once, even if multiple modules depend on it. Return the changed file paths to the caller.

## Research: bundlers and task executors

These observations describe the inspected implementations, not guarantees for
every release or file type. Bazel is included as a build-system reference.

| System | Restart validation | Tradeoff |
| --- | --- | --- |
| webpack | Dependency snapshots. Module snapshots default to timestamps in development and timestamps plus hashes in production. Uses a safety window for timestamp precision. | Passing timestamp checks avoid content reads, but rely on timestamp behavior. |
| Turbopack | File reads are session-dependent tasks. A new session rereads files and compares results against persisted hashes. | Reads inputs again; unchanged results can avoid downstream recomputation. |
| Parcel v2 | Saves a watcher snapshot and queries changes since that snapshot. FSEvents and Watchman provide historical queries; traversal backends compare paths and mtimes. | Cost and detection behavior depend on the backend. |
| Parcel v3 branch | The inspected startup path creates new build state and supports in-process incremental updates. No persistent build-cache restoration path was found. | No restart-validation strategy confirmed in the inspected revision. |
| Bazel | Obtains input digests and uses them to validate action-cache entries. Existing digests may be available; otherwise it reads files to compute them. | Fast digest access requires support that ordinary local files may not have. |

### Timestamp safety windows

webpack uses `safeTime = mtime + estimated precision` to account for changes that may share the same timestamp. It trusts a matching timestamp only if `safeTime` is no later than the previous build’s start time.

This still relies on a sufficient precision estimate and does not detect content changes that preserve an old timestamp. [Source](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/lib/fs/FileSystemInfo.js).

## Open questions

- How should we handle a file changing between a plugin reading it and Rolldown hashing it? We defer this edge case for now.
- The hash algorithm, validation timing, and whether to track file metadata remain open.
- Should we add an `mtime` + `safeTime` optimization to avoid hashing files when timestamp checks pass?
- Should we add platform-specific optimizations, such as using a saved FSEvents event ID on macOS to query changes since the previous run? How should we fall back when event history is unavailable or incomplete?

## Verification

1. Unchanged inputs: Save a cache and restart without editing any tracked files. Expect no changed paths.
2. Changed contents: Edit `a.ts` or its registered dependency `theme.json` while stopped. Expect the edited path to be reported as changed.
3. Deleted files: Delete a tracked `theme.json` while stopped. Expect its path to be reported as changed.
4. Previously missing files: Build `a.ts` with `theme.json` registered as a dependency but missing. Create `theme.json` while stopped, then restart. Expect its path to be reported as changed and `a.ts` to be rebuilt.
5. Preserved `mtime`: Change `theme.json` contents, restore its original `mtime`, and restart. Expect its path to be reported as changed.
6. Shared files: Register `theme.json` as a dependency of both `a.ts` and `b.ts`. Expect validation to check it once and report its path once if changed.
7. Changes during validation: Modify a file while validation reads it. Use this case to verify the concurrent-change policy once it is defined.
8. Build correctness: After editing `theme.json`, compare the output of a build using the saved cache with a clean build using the same inputs. Expect matching output.
9. Performance: Measure restart builds with no edits and with one edited file. Include validation, restoration, and cache-update costs, and compare total time with a build without saved cache.

The existing [M1 acceptance criteria](../milestones.md#m1-persistent-scan-cache) remain the delivery requirements.
