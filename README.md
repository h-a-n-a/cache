# Cache

Design and planning for caching in [Rolldown](https://github.com/rolldown/rolldown):
a persistent cache on disk, a cache shared across git worktrees, and incremental
builds that redo only the work whose cache key changed. The code itself lands in
Rolldown.

## Layout

| Path                             | What it holds                                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`goals.md`](goals.md)           | The end result of caching in Rolldown, and what is out of scope. Read this first. |
| [`principles.md`](principles.md) | Rules that every design follows.                                                  |
| [`design-docs/`](design-docs/)   | One record per feature or decision: what and why.                                 |
| [`milestones.md`](milestones.md) | The order of work, the features in each milestone, and their status.              |

## Goals and principles

To decide where an idea belongs, ask:

- **Goal:** Does this describe a result users should get?
  If yes, put it in `goals.md`. For example, different worktrees of the same
  project can reuse cached results.
- **Principle:** Does this give us a rule for accepting or rejecting a design,
  even when another choice offers benefits?
  If yes, put it in `principles.md`. For example, reject a faster design if
  caching can change the correct build result.

A concern can belong to both: correctness is a user goal and a design constraint.
Add a principle when it helps decide between designs; there is no need to create
a separate principle for every goal.

## Adding a design doc

1. Copy [`design-docs/0000-template.md`](design-docs/0000-template.md) to
   `design-docs/NNNN-short-name.md`, using the next free number.
2. Add the feature to its milestone in [`milestones.md`](milestones.md) and
   link the new doc.

## Design status and implementation

Each design doc records its status and implementation PRs in its frontmatter:

```yaml
status: proposal
implementation: []
```

- `proposal`: the design is still being explored or discussed.
- `accepted`: an explicit decision has been made to adopt the design.

Either status can appear on this repository's `main`. Implementation and
validation may start while the design is a proposal, but Rolldown implementation
PRs must not merge until the design is accepted. Acceptance does not imply that
implementation is complete.

List all Rolldown PR URLs that implement the design under `implementation`,
including every relevant PR in a stack. Track implementation through these PRs
and delivery through [`milestones.md`](milestones.md).

## Workflow

1. Start from a milestone and discuss the problem and possible approaches.
2. Create or update a design doc with `status: proposal`. Describe the proposed
   behavior, open questions, and validation plan, and link it from the milestone.
3. Refine the proposal through research, discussion, and implementation
   experiments as needed.
4. Mark the design `accepted` once an explicit decision is made to adopt it.
5. Complete implementation, review, and required checks, then merge the
   Rolldown PRs.
6. Verify the acceptance criteria and update the milestone.

For example, a storage prototype may reveal costs that require revising the
proposal before acceptance.
